    <p style='font-size: 14px'>
      In this lab session we are gonna analyze a dataset which shows the relationship between
      maternal smoking and the baby's birth weight. A low birth weight is known to be
      a contributing factor to a number of infant deaths, and babies with a low birth
      weight (who survives) are more prone to various health problems. Here we try to
      understand the effect of smoking on birth weight. In particular, we are interested in 
      understanding to what extent smoking during pregnancy affect the birth weight of babies.
      Before we start our analysis, it is important to point out that we need to trust the data
      that was gathered by the researchers and also trust them on the fact that any difference that
      is seen in birth weight is probabely related to smoking and no other extra factor that was not
      considered by the researchers plays a role.

	# mothers share something in common which is the effect of smoking on gestation.

	# both groups to obtain more precise estiamte of the effect of gestation on birth weight.
