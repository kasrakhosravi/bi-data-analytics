	Previously, we have explored single and multiple variables and then used a linear model
	to quantify the relationship between two variables. We will keep our previous work by prediciting
	new values for the dataset that we have not explored previously.

<h5 id="welcome-to-github-pages">Exploring Pairwise Relationship</h5>   
	    
<p style='font-size: 14px'>
	We have explored single variables and used tools like histograms, boxplots, barplots and numercial summaries
	to get more familiar with the dataset. Now lets move on to analysing pairwise relationships. Our interest for
	this part is to understand the relationship between variables. For isntance is there a relationship between the
	price of the house and the number of bathrooms? Remember that here we are just exploring variables and it is in the
	model phase that we quantify the relationships but analysing the relationship at this stage is useful to detect anamolies,
	errors, outliers, subgroups, etc. which an guide the modellig phase.

# (Plot 1): A typical tool to use to see the relationship between two variables is a scatterplot
with(housingData, plot(
	SqM,
	Price,
	cex = 2.5,
	pch = 21,
	bg = 'grey'
))
	
# (Plot 2): Next we try to include a smoothening curve into the data. We do that by using the 'smooth.spline()' function and pass it into the 'lines()' function in order to draw it. You can also see that we assign the 'df = 5' to give the smoothening curve a higher degree of freedom for more flexibility. Try assigning lower and higher values for the 'df' parameter to see what happens. It seems that lower 'df' will follow the sample data trend less strictly and a higher value is more flexibile in following its trend.
with(housingData, lines(
	smooth.spline(SqM, Price, df = 5),
	col = 'red'
))
	
# (Plot 3 & 4): But assigning a high value for 'df' for every variable and dataset will not always give us a flexible and reliable model. Check out this one and see if you can reason why the red line is not quite representative of the sample dataset.
with(housingData, plot(
	Price,
	Offers,
	cex = 2.5,
	pch = 21,
	bg = 'grey'
))
with(housingData, lines(
	smooth.spline(Price, Offers, df = 5),
	col = 'red'
))
	
# (Plot 5): When we have lots of variables and would like to get a general overview about their relationship, we use the following command. Try looking at the graph and see if you can detect each pairs related scatterplot (for instance price ~ bathrooms) and also its reversed version (which means that the location of variables get reversed like bathroom ~price)	
pairs(housingData[c(
	'Price', 'SqM', 'Bedrooms', 'Bathrooms', 'Offers'
)])
	
# (Plot 6): Boxplots are not only used for single variables. We can see the spread of one variable compared to another variable using boxplot. Lets try doing that.
with(housingData, boxplot(
	Price ~ Neighborhood,
	horizontal = TRUE,
	xlab = 'Price',
	ylab = 'Neighborhood'
))
# It is interesting to detect here that neighborhood 'West' has almost the highest (absolute and average) price ranges comapred to the other neighborhoods. That is a really valuable information

# Another tool to use for pairwise relationship is 'correlation' which measures the degree of linear association between two variables. Here is how we do it.
with(housingData, cor(
	Price , SqFt
))
# As you can see, the 'cor' equals to '0.55'. Lets interpret this number a little bit more. 'cor' measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. Here the direction is positive and direct and the strength of the relationship is above '50%' which can be an indicator of a strong relationship (It depends!). But imagine if the relationship between 'Price' and 'SqFt' was not linear then the interpretation we just made would be wrong. Also, correlation does not imply causation; The increase of SqFt of the house does not cause the price of the house to go higher. We might deal with a positive and strong relationship but in fact the correlation would be spurious (This can happen by coincidence or the presence of a third unseen factor). In the end, it is importnatn to mention that we need to be careful about interpreting correlation between discrete variables since very different datasets can have similar summary statistics which can lead to wrong conclusions.

# Additionally, if we want to measure the correlation across various variables, this is how we do it. Using the 'round' function is just for having a cleaner output in the end and not having to deal with long decimal numbers.
round(cor(
	housingData[c('Price', 'SqFt', 'Bedrooms')]
), 2)
	
# (Plot 7): We have previously argued why it is not a good idea to use 'cor' for categorical variables and instead we use the 'cross-tabulation' oncept. On the other hand it is possible to use barplots to compare categorical variables.
with(housingData, barplot(
	height = table(Brick, Neighborhood),
	legend = c('Other', 'Brick'),
	beside = TRUE
))

<h5 id="welcome-to-github-pages">Modelling (Quantifying) Relationships Between Pairs of Variables</h5>   
	    
<p style='font-size: 14px'>
	Until now we have explored different ways to explore variables in order to find pattersn, signals and
	trends. Next step would be you build a model or in other words quantify the relationships we have explored
	previously. In other words we would like to get the previous data and use it to predict future values. We actually
	had many questions like that in the finance course. When you want to C if it is rational to buy an asset C; In that
	scenario you are using history data to make predictions about future. That sounds fun :)
