	Data exploration is crucial in today's world; especially in the busines world. What we mean by data exploration
	is to provide an overview of the data, to tell a story, suggest hypothesises, detect trends, and dsicover subgroups. We are dealing with various types of	
	different types of variables like numerical (discrete or continues), categorical and ordinal and data exploration
	will give us the tools and concepts to handle those variables and get valuable insights from them.

	It is crucial to examine waht kind of object we are working with in R. It turns out
	that R offers us a wide range of functions to do that. Lets explore some of them considering
	that we have already loaded a dataset called 'marketingData'

      <p style='font-size: 14px'>
	Lets explore some advanced stuff. In R we have the ability to create our functions which makes
	life easier on so many levels. We define a function once and we can use i t many times during 
        our program. If you think about it all of the other stuff we are using in R are already functions.
	Function is just like a factory that accepts an input and then gives us an output. Lets create some
	some functions together.
