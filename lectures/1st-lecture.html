                Data exploration is crucial in today's world; especially in the busines realm. What we mean by data exploration
                is to <b>provide an overview of the data, to tell a story, suggest hypothesises, detect trends, and dsicover subgroups</b>.
                We are dealing with various types of different types of variables like numerical (discrete or continues), categorical and
                ordinal; Data exploration will give us the tools and concepts to handle those variables and get valuable insights from
                them. R is a tool (in other words a programming language with a bundle of external libraries) that is built to help us achieve
                these goals

                It is crucial to examine what kind of object we are working with in R. It turns out
                that R offers us a wide range of functions to do that. Lets explore some of them considering
                that we have already loaded a dataset called 'marketingData'

                The dataset that we have consists of different variables like 'Salary' or 'Children'. First, we will

                    # We can explore the summary statistics of a single variable in a dataset which will give us values like min and max numbers, mean, median, etc.
                    with(marketingData, summary(Salary))


                    # (1st Plot) Also it is possible to draw a histogram based on a single variable. It shows us a general overview about the distribution of the variable values.

                    # It is beneficial to mention that calculating summary statistics is not useful for every type of dataset like categorical or discrete values. For instance in this dataset, Children variable can only have discrete values in order to be meaningful; therefore calculating its mean will not give us much of an important result. What does it mean to have 0.934 children? :)
                    with(marketingData, mean(Children))


                    # (2nd Plot) We have used a histogram before but histogram is not the best option to compare data distribution. We have the option to use density plots which is great for comparing with other values (Even though we are only exploring one variable and not multiple variables here)
                    with(marketingData, plot(density(Salary), xlab='Salary'))


                    # (Plot 3) Lets see what happens when we bring a histogram and a density plot together. Magic Happens :)

                    # (Plot 4) We are still exploring single values but lets bring few hsitograms with different variables into a single plot and compare them. Remember that we can only draw plots for variables with numeric values
                    par(mfrow = c(1,4))

                Lets explore some advanced stuff. In R we have the ability to create our functions which makes
                life easier on so many levels. We define a function once and we can use it many times during
                our program. If you think about it, all of the other stuff we are using in R are already functions.
                Function is just like a factory that accepts an input and then gives us an output. Lets create some
                functions together.
