<h4 id="welcome-to-github-pages">Third Lab</h4>  

<p style='font-size: 14px'>
	In this lab session we are gonna analyze a dataset which shows the relationship between
	maternal smoking and the baby's birth weight. A low birth weight is known to be
	a contributing factor to a number of infant deaths, and babies with a low birth
	weight (who survives) are more prone to various health problems. Here we try to
	understand the effect of smoking on birth weight. In particular, we are interested in 
	understanding to what extent smoking during pregnancy affect the birth weight of babies.
	Before we start our analysis, it is important to point out that we need to trust the data
	that was gathered by the researchers and also trust them on the fact that any difference that
	is seen in birth weight is probabely related to smoking and no other extra factor that was not
	considered by the researchers plays a role.
